<h1 style = color:olive> Our Philosophy </h1>
<p style = color:black> The School’s teaching philosophy is underpinned by a strong commitment to exposing students to both the theoretical and practical 
    aspects of learning, and our lectured teaching is complemented by teaching students in their home languages. Facilitated in smaller 
    groups, classes are highly interactive and students are given a unique opportunity to understand in depth and put in practise the theory
    to which they have been exposed to in lectures.

    Real-world scenarios and case studies are used to stimulate optimal learning and prepare students for the exams. We remain aware of 
    the critical subject and teacher shortage that exists in the public schools of South Africa, and our aim is to produce well-rounded 
    students who have had fully opportunities to high level education and the advatage to choose from a variety of major subjects.</p>
